# Legend open-source docs

This is the documentation for all of [Legend's](https://legendapp.com) open-source projects. Currently the Legend-State docs are here and we're in the process of migrating over the Legend-Motion docs.

The documentation uses [Starlight by Astro](https://starlight.astro.build/), with live editing using [React-Live](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-live), and example components built in React.

## Running

You can run everything locally with Astro to edit the examples yourself. It uses [bun](https://bun.sh/), though it would probably work with a different package manager.

```bash
cd packages/state
bun i
bun dev
```

## Contributing

We welcome any contributions you'd like to make! If there are any typos or mistakes, additional explanation needed, or you'd like to add more examples, we would love your help.

If you want to make a larger change like adding a page or restructuring, it would be good to have a discussion about that first, so please [post an issue](https://github.com/LegendApp/legend-docs/issues/new).
