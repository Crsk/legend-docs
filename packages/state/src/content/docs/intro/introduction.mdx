Legend-State is a super fast and powerful state library for modern JavaScript apps with four primary goals:

### 1. <span className="text-lg">ü¶Ñ</span> As easy as possible to use

There is no boilerplate and there are no contexts, actions, reducers, dispatchers, sagas, thunks, or epics. It doesn't modify your data at all, and you can just call `get()` to get the raw data and `set()` to change it.

React components can track access to `get()` on any observable and automatically re-render whenever it changes.

:::note
We use a `$` suffix on variables as a convention to indicate an observable but it's not required.

### 2. <span className="text-lg">‚ö°Ô∏è</span> The fastest React state library

Legend-State beats every other state library on just about every metric and is so optimized for arrays that it even beats vanilla JS on the "swap" and "replace all rows" benchmarks. At only `4kb` and with the massive reduction in boilerplate code, you'll have big savings in file size too.

See [Fast üî•](../fast) for more details of why Legend-State is so fast.

### 3. üî• Fine-grained reactivity for minimal renders

Legend-State lets you make your renders super fine-grained allowing only the leaves of your component tree to re-render when required, thus making your apps go faster üî•, and removing unnecessary overhead from React's render cycle.

All examples in these docs are editable so you can play around with the code and see how it works.

### 4. üíæ Powerful persistence

Legend-State includes a powerful [persistence plugin system](../../guides/persistence) for local caching and remote sync. It easily enables local-first apps by optimistically applying and caching all changes to ensure they sync, managing conflict resolution, and syncing only changes. We use Legend-State as the sync systems in [Legend](https://legendapp.com) and [Bravely](https://bravely.io), so it is by necessity very full featured while being simple to set up.

Local persistence plugins for the browser and React Native are included, and remote sync plugins for Firebase Realtime Database, TanStack Query, and `fetch`.

```js
import { configureObservablePersistence, synced } from '@legendapp/state/persist'
import { ObservablePersistLocalStorage } from '@legendapp/state/persist-plugins/local-storage'

// Setup global sync options, also configurable per observable
configureObservablePersistence({
    pluginLocal: ObservablePersistLocalStorage,
});

const state$ = synced({
    // Two-way bind this observable to a remote server
    get: () => fetch(url).then(r => r.json()),
    set: ({ value }) => fetch(url, { method: 'POST', data: JSON.stringify(value) }),
    // Cache data locally
    cache: {
        local: 'store'
    },
})

// Getting the value activates it to start syncing
state$.store.user.name.get()

// Setting a value automatically syncs with the server
state$.store.user.name.set('Annyong')
```

<Install name="@legendapp/state@next" />

## Highlights

- ‚ú® Super easy to use üòå
- ‚ú® Super fast ‚ö°Ô∏è
- ‚ú® Super small at 4kb üê•
- ‚ú® Fine-grained reactivity üî•
- ‚ú® No boilerplate
- ‚ú® Designed for maximum performance and scalability
- ‚ú® React components re-render only on changes
- ‚ú® Very strongly typed with TypeScript
- ‚ú® Persistence plugins for automatically saving/loading from storage
- ‚ú® State can be global or within components

The core is platform agnostic so you can use it in vanilla JS or any framework to create and listen to observables. It includes support for React and React Native, and has plugins for automatically persisting to storage.
