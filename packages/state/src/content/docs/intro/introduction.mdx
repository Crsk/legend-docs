Legend-State is a super fast all-in-one state and sync library that lets you write less code to make faster apps. Legend-State has four primary goals:

### 1. ü¶Ñ As easy as possible to use

There is no boilerplate and there are no contexts, actions, reducers, dispatchers, sagas, thunks, or epics. You can structure your data however you want in local or global stores. It doesn't modify your data at all, and you can just call `get()` to get the raw data and `set()` to change it.

```js
const settings$ = observable({ theme: 'dark' })

// get returns the raw data
settings$.theme.get() === 'dark'
// set sets
settings$.theme.set('light')

// Computed observables with just a function
const isDark$ = observable(() => settings$.theme.get() === 'dark');

// observing contexts re-run when tracked observables change
observe(() => {
  console.log(settings$.theme.get())
})

```

React components can track access to `get()` on observables and automatically re-render whenever they change.

Many examples in these docs are editable so you can play around with the code and see how it works.

### 2. ‚ö°Ô∏è The fastest React state library

Legend-State beats every other state library on just about every metric and is so optimized for arrays that it even beats vanilla JS on the "swap" and "replace all rows" benchmarks. At only `4kb` and with the massive reduction in boilerplate code, you'll have big savings in file size too.

See [Fast üî•](../fast) for more details of why Legend-State is so fast.

### 3. üî• Fine-grained reactivity for minimal renders

Legend-State helps your components re-render less, less often, making your apps faster üî•.

### 4. üíæ Powerful sync and persistence

Legend-State includes a powerful [sync and persistence system](../../guides/persistence). It easily enables local-first apps by optimistically applying all changes locally first, ensuring they eventually sync, managing conflict resolution, and syncing minimal diffs. We use Legend-State as the sync systems in [Legend](https://legendapp.com) and [Bravely](https://bravely.io), so it is by necessity very full featured while being simple to set up.

Local persistence plugins for the browser and React Native are included, and remote sync plugins for Firebase Realtime Database, TanStack Query, and `fetch`.

```js
import { synced } from '@legendapp/state/sync'
import { ObservablePersistLocalStorage } from '@legendapp/state/persist-plugins/local-storage'

const store$ = synced({
    // Two-way bind this observable to a remote server
    get: () => fetch(url).then(r => r.json()),
    set: ({ value }) => fetch(url, { method: 'POST', data: JSON.stringify(value) }),
    // Cache data locally
    cache: {
        local: 'store',
        plugin: ObservablePersistLocalStorage
    },
})

// Getting the value activates it to fetch
store$.user.name.get()

// Setting a value automatically syncs with the server
store$.user.name.set('Annyong')
```

## Install

import Install from "shared/src/Components/Install/Install.astro";

<Install name="@legendapp/state@next" />

## Highlights

- ‚ú® Super easy to use üòå
- ‚ú® Super fast ‚ö°Ô∏è
- ‚ú® Super small at 4kb üê•
- ‚ú® Fine-grained reactivity üî•
- ‚ú® Built-in sync system
- ‚ú® No boilerplate
- ‚ú® Designed for maximum performance and scalability
- ‚ú® React components re-render only on changes
- ‚ú® Very strongly typed with TypeScript
- ‚ú® Persistence plugins for automatically saving/loading from storage
- ‚ú® State can be global or within components

The core is platform agnostic so you can use it in vanilla JS or any framework to create and listen to observables. It includes support for React and React Native, and has plugins for automatically persisting to storage.
