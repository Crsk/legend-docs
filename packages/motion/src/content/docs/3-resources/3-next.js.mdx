There are a few extra steps to get Legend-Motion working on Next.js.

First, Legend-Motion and its dependencies need to be added to the transpile list.

import Install from "shared/src/Components/Install/Install.astro";

<Install name="next-transpile-modules" className="mb-8" />

Then wrap your export in `next.config.js` with `withTM`. This is the full config needed to setup Legend-Motion including Linear Gradient and SVG features. You can remove those lines if you don't need them.

```js
const withTM = require("next-transpile-modules")([
  "@legendapp/motion",
  // Only required for MotionLinearGradient:
  "react-native-linear-gradient",
  // Only required for MotionSvg:
  "react-native-svg",
]);

module.exports = withTM({
  webpack(cfg) {
    cfg.resolve.alias = {
      ...(cfg.resolve.alias || {}),
      "react-native$": "react-native-web",
      // Only required for MotionLinearGradient:
      "react-native-linear-gradient": "react-native-web-linear-gradient",
    };
    // Only required for MotionSvg:
    cfg.resolve.extensions = [
      ".web.js",
      ".web.jsx",
      ".web.ts",
      ".web.tsx",
      ...cfg.resolve.extensions,
    ];

    return cfg;
  },
});
```

**_Note_**: The reason for these changes is that `react-native-svg` needs `.web.js` to be added to the resolve extensions, and Linear Gradient requires aliasing `react-native-linear-gradient` to `react-native-web-linear-gradient`.
